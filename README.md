# Question-Paper-Generator
This was an assessment task from the company Reelo. In this task, I was given the task of creating a question paper generator. This was a backend task.

Purpose:

The Question Paper Generator application is designed to automatically generate question papers based on specified parameters, such as total marks, difficulty distribution, and subject or topic filters.

Input:

The application takes the following input parameters:

Total marks: The total number of marks for the question paper.
Difficulty distribution: The percentage of marks allocated to each difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
Subject or topic filters: Optional filters to restrict the questions to a specific subject or topic.
Output:

The application generates a question paper in a structured format, including question numbering, proper spacing, and clear separation between different sections based on difficulty.
